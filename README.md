server URL: http://ec2-18-184-41-163.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com

in this project i installed postgreSQL as the database and made apache2 as the server.  
also added a user called grader, as requested gave him 'sudo' permissions, removed the access to the server using Password instead u have to use private key and password.  
enabled the firewall, firewall accepts only requests from 2200, 80 and 123 TPC.   

took the application from this repo https://github.com/dgailh/udacity-catalog and made few changes.
